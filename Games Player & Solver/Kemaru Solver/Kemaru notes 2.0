Exclude common neighbors from same cage:

for every number
	for every cage
		cage_size
		for every position
			if it respects cage nbr
				if it is the 1st position
					record position neighbors (for the 1st cage position)
				else
					no common = 0
					for recorded position
						common neighbors=0
						for new position
							common neighbors?
							=> if so, common neighbors=1
						end
						if ~common neighbors
							disable recorded position
							if recorded=disabled
								break loop (recorded position)
								no common =1
							end
						end
					end
					new_recorded=recorded-disabled
				end
			end
		end
	end
end

% Need to exclude possibilities within cage => rec_pos around
